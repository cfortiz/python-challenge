Module 3 Challenge - Use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python
challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

## PyBank

This challenge requires that we import data from a CSV file, analyze it,
prepare a report from that analysis, and finally export that report to a text
file and print it to standard output.

The script has no third party module dependencies, but should be run with
python 3.12 or later, since it uses new features for f-string literals which
allow nesting the same type of quotation marks inside interpolated expressions
(see [PEP-701](https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/) for details).

### Instructions

From the main repo directory, change directory to `PyBank`, then run the
`main.py` script.

```
cd PyBank
python main.py
```

### Files

* `PyBank/main.py`: script that solves the PyBank challenge requirements
* `PyBank/Resources/budget_data.py`: CSV file with budget data (provided)
* `PyBank/analysis/budget_data_analysis.txt`: Text report of analysis results.
